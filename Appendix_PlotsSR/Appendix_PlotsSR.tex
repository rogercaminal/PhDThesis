\chapter{Additional jet distributions in the signal regions}
    \label{app:SRkimenaticDistr}

This appendix collects the most relevant distributions for jets in the final state, in the signal regions M1 to M6.
The distributions for the leading jet and $\met$ $\phi$, the $\Delta\Phi$ between the leading jet and the $\met$, the leading jet charged fraction, the second leading jet $\pt$, the jet multiplicity, and the second leading jet $\eta$ and $\phi$ are shown.
